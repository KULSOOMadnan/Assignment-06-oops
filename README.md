# OOP Concepts - All Assignments Completed 🚀

## Overview 🌟
This project represents my journey in learning and applying **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts by completing **21 assignments** from the **OOP Practice Series** in the **Learn Modern AI Python** repository. Each of these assignments helped me build and strengthen core OOP concepts in Python. 🐍

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Classes and Objects** 🏗️
- **Inheritance** 🧑‍🏫
- **Polymorphism** 🔄
- **Encapsulation** 🔒
- **Abstraction** 💡
- **Composition and Aggregation** 🔗
- **Decorators and Static Methods** 🏅
- **Custom Exceptions, Iterators, and Generators** ⚙️

By working through these tasks, I got hands-on experience with various essential OOP principles. Let’s dive into the details!

## Concepts Covered 📚
- **Classes & Objects**: Creating the basic structure of classes and objects.
- **Method Overloading**: Creating methods with different parameters.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**: Extending classes and modifying inherited methods.
- **Static & Class Methods**: Class-level behavior and methods that don’t rely on instance data.
- **Decorators**: Modifying class and function behaviors using decorators.
- **Exception Handling**: Creating and handling custom exceptions to manage errors.
- **Iterable Classes**: Implementing custom iterators using `__iter__` and `__next__`.
- **Generators**: Writing generator functions for better memory management.
- **Composition & Aggregation**: Combining multiple classes for complex relationships.

## Repository Information 📦
